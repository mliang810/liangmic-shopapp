<h3>Purpose</h3>
Making a site similar to Etsy where users can set up their own shops and add items not neccessarily native to the site (eg amazon links). Site will take uploaded photos.

<h3>Audience</h3>
Target audience is relatively broad -- anyone interested in lifestyle goods and or merchandise from a small business.

<h3>CRUD</h3>
Users will be able to create their own "shops" and create item listings. They can also remove items from their store, or their entire store if they wish. Users will also have the ability to sign up and log in to site accounts to mangage their shops and listings or save/delete posts to a bookmarks list. 
Users can view their shop, or others' shops from an index on the website's homepage. 

<h3>Addtional Feature</h3>
Users have the ability to generate and manage bookmarks of their favorite pages or items.
